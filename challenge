Given the attached CSV file, write a function find_open_restaurants(filename,
day, time) which takes as parameters a filename, a day (Mon-Fri) and a time (in hh:mm
format) and returns a list of restaurant names which are open on that day and time.
Assumptions:
 If a day of the week is not listed, the restaurant is closed on that day
 All times are local — don’t worry about timezone-awareness
 The CSV file will be well-formed
