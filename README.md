# python_find_open_restaurants_test
I was sent a test in email which looked pretty simple but however took me 6 straight days of at least one 8 straight hours writing lines of python code. It looked rather simplistic, however it had me pulling out all the basics of python I ever knew with me touching modules like pandas, regex and datetime with a truck load of list comprehension and boatload of split(). This is a documentation of my own solution. By the way I KNOW this can do with a lot of improvement, but this works.
I put this out there as a learning piece for python people who want to learn.
